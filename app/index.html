                            <p>John Savelid is waiting for me at Stockholm airport holding a strange bag that looks like a rucksack with too many straps. "It's a day sack for skating," he tells me, "but also a life jacket in case you go through."</p>

                                          <p>It was the question on all of our minds, but I asked it: "How do you know when the ice isn't safe to skate on?" Niklas, our imperturbable guide, rubbed his chin, looked thoughtful for a moment, then offered up the distilled wisdom of a lifetime spent playing around on frozen water. "When it breaks," he said with a broad smile.</p>

I hadn’t expected this sudden, ­unnerving divide. I hadn’t expected to be so far from land. And I hadn’t ­expected to be told that the solid surface I was standing on was only 3in thick.</p>

                          <p>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and takes you directly towards the chosen skating area. Arriving to the hostel/hotel you check in and then depending on the time of arrival we might be able to do some skating. We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. In the evening we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</p>
                          <h4>Day II – III</h4>
                          <p>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on the weather forecast and the ice situation on the lakes, we take off in the minibus towards the best possible skating area. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we get the gear on and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we make several stops when we go ashore to take something to eat or walk to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>
                          <h4>Day IV</h4>
                          <p>After breakfast we head off for another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the scheduled departure times. On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and change clothes and maybe for something to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.</p>

                          <p class="lead">Naturguiden skating trips gives you the opportunity to experience the unique adventure of skating on natural ice on some of Sweden’s many lakes or the Baltic Sea.</p>
                          <p>It is an activity that closely interacts with the conditions that the  nature and the weather give us. It could be a question about finding the limits  for what is possible. How fare can we go before the ice breaks, when is it safe  to continue and when is it time to go back? To be able to judge and make the  right decisions you need experience and a safety oriented approach. The  Naturguiden guides have that experience and always consider the safety aspects.  This short information gives you all the practical and safety information you  need to get right equipped for a safe and comfortable skating weekend.</p>
                          <h3>Weather</h3>
                          <p>The weahter is  always difficult to predict. It could be well below ten degree or it can be just  above zero and rain. You can get an idea by check the weather forecast before  you leave, but you do not know exact where we will skate. Can be decided by very  short notice depending on the situation.</p>
                          <p>There could also  be water on the ice, not nice to fall into that.</p>
                          <h3>Equipment that you NEED TO bring <big>VERY IMPORTANT!!!</big></h3>
                          <p>There is always a  small chance that the ice will break and you fall into the water. Even during  extreme conditions with severe cold and being far out in the wilderness it  should not involve any safety risks for you. It should even be possibly to  continue the skating trip as planed. To be able to achieve that it’s <strong>an  absolut need to bring a complete change of clothes. </strong>If it happened you  can not live without it!</p>
                          <p>All clothes SHALL  be packed in the dry sack (provided by us) and should include the following. It  shall be packed in the same order as it is listed, first things at the  bottom.</p>

                              <h4>Day 1</h4>
                              <p>Arrival at Östersund airport or by train at the station. Transfer with bus to Ljungdalen. Your guide will meet you at the bus stop and show you the way to the hostel. You get your room and then we will have a nice dinner together. After dinner we try out ski boots and skies and wind down the evening by informing you about the following days, the weather forecast and all you need to know.</p>
                              <h4>Day II</h4>
                              <p>After breakfast buffet but before we head off for the mountains, we prepare ourselves big lunch packages. The first stage is up to the ski slope. Before we start we need some exercise in going downhill on cross country skies. It is a little tricky, but with the right technique it becomes much easier.</p>
                              <p>After exercising we eat our lunch in the ski slope and then let the ski lift pull us up towards the summit once again. This time we should not go downhill again but continue towards the very top. When passing it you get marvellous views, mountains everywhere. We will see the dramatic mountain Helags, the target for tomorrow, in front of us, but we head of towards Fältjägaren, a small cabin in the middle of noware. It starts with a small slope, your practise will come handy. Then we leave the trail and head straight in between the mountains, the guide showing the right way. We take some breaks along the way and reach Fältjägaren in the late afternoon. Fältjägaren is a small lodge with two big rooms. Built by the military after an accident when a patrol got lost in bad weather and one person froze to death. . It has no washing facilities and the toilet is in a separate building. After skiing the whole day it is now time to prepare the dinner together and end up the day around the small table in the cabin. You will probably sleep well after this long day.</p>
                              <h4>Day III</h4>
                              <p>You will wake up with the view of Helags, one of the highest mountains in Sweden, 1797 meters. If the weather is good enough we probably will be at the top before this day has end. After breakfast and a couple of hours skiing we reach the the mountain and start the climbing. We enjoy the day and are in no hurry. When it starts to get more steep we stop for a lunch break. We dig a cosy couch in the snow that gives us shelter. The couch is a perfect place for lunch, still with awesome views. From here we walk on the snow to the summit, leaving skies and backpacks behind. One hour later we reach the top and we will have amazing views in all directions. It feels satisfying to put our names in the guestbook after climbing an altitude difference of 800 meters.</p>
                              <p>Back to the skies and time for a short break in our cosy couch Then we continue towards Helags mountain lodge, our next stop. Downhill almost the whole way. Before we leave to our lodge we will have time to relax. After skiing the whole day it is now time to prepare the dinner together and end up the day in the warming and relaxing sauna and a nice shower.</p>
                              <h4>Day IV</h4>
                              <p>This day we follow the marked tracks towards Ljungdalen. If we have met no people in earlier days, we will probably meet some today. It goes up and down over some minor mountains and after 13 km, you get the last part downhill from the mountain through the forest down to the village Ljungdalen. In the afternoon we are back. A welcome shower or maybe a visit to the small indoor swimming pool is waiting. A good dinner ends a fantastic tour before it is time for the bus back to Östersund.</p>

                              <p>Arrival at Östersund Airport or with train at the station. Transfer with bus to Ljungdalen (14:20 – 18:05).

This time we should not go downhill again but continue towards the very top. When passing it you get marvellous views, mountains everywhere. We continue for some hours before we find ourselves a good place to build our igloos. We take turns with the shovel to dig a cave big enough. When ready we put our sleeping pads on the beds and make ourselves comfortable in our new home. Before we prepare our dinner there is time to relax. We end up the day with a short tour, watching the sun set and getting warm before going to bed in our winter sleeping bags.</p>
                              <h4>Day III</h4>
                              <p>The third day, we wake up in our igloo, make ourselves a warm breakfast and then head of towards the Helags, one of the highest mountains in Sweden, 1797 meters. If the weather is good enough we head for the summit, starting the climb after a couple of hours skiing. Further on we leave our skies and backpacks and walk the last ascent to the summit. One hour later we reach the top and we will have amazing views in all directions. It feels satisfying to put our names in the guestbook after climbing an altitude difference of 800 meters.</p>
                              <p>Back to the skies and time for a lunch break. We dig a cosy couch in the snow that gives us shelter. The couch is a perfect place for lunch, still with unending views. Then we continue towards the mountain station, downwards almost the whole way. Before we go to our lodge there is time to relax. Together, we prepare dinner and eat and just relax afterwards.</p>
                              <h4>Day IV</h4>
                              <p>Today we go off the marked tracks altogether, 22 km strait over the mountains. The compass will show us the way. If we have met some people in earlier days, we will not meet any today. It goes up and down over some minor mountains and ends up in a valley. We enjoy the day and are in no hurry, the sun is up to after eight o clock. Taking some nice breaks, we maybe try some ice fishing on the lakes we pass over.</p>
                              <p>The last stretch down to Ljungdalen is downhill, hopefully not too steep. In the evening we are back at the hostel. A welcome shower or maybe a visit to the small indoor swimming pool is waiting. A good dinner ends a fantastic tour.</p>
                              <h4>Day V</h4>
                              <p>Early breakfast and then to the bus that leaves at 06.00. Back in Östersund at half past nine. Take an early plane back home or take some hours in the city of Östersund.</p>

                              <p class="lead">Visit the highest mountain region of Sweden, situated in the far north-east parts of the country. Here we will be skiing during late spring, early summer, when there is still snow. During this time of the year, we almost will experience the midnight sun, a time of the year when the sun only sets for an hour midnight. We will then be able to ski during the whole day and the whole night. For sleeping, there are nice cabins to spend the nights, or days in, depending on when we want to ski. The strong sun and white snow makes it essential to bring sunglasses, a hat and sun factor.</p>

                              <p>Arrival at Kiruna Airport or with train at the station. Transfer with bus to Abisko. Your guide will meet you at the airport. In Abisko we step on the skies and start our tour immediately. After a while, getting away from the civilisation, we stop for a late lunch. The days are long this time of the year, they almost never ends; we are in no hurry and take it easy up the mountains. In the evening we reach our mountain cabin where we should spend three nights completely by our self. We make our self comfortable and then start preparing dinner together. Maybe we can eat it outdoor? The mountain cabin is very simple, but nice and clean. The toilet is in a separate building. The washing facilities is a bucket in the common kitchen or outdoor.</p>
                              <h4>Day II</h4>
                              <p>The topic for this second day is a summit tour in the midnight sun. The sun sets at 23:40 and even later on the summit.</p>
                              <p>But first breakfast in the morning and then a tour before lunch. We rest for a while in the cabin during the afternoon or stays out in the sun to increase the tan. Dinner at five o’clock and then we head of for the summit. Reaching it about 23:30, digging a couch towards the sun and then just wait to se the sun hide behind the mountains for an hour. In the midnight hour we heading downhill again back towards our cabin, reaching it approximately at dawn at 01:40</p>
                              <h4>Day III</h4>
                              <p>The third day, we wake up a little late and decide during breakfast where to ski this day. Maybe we take a long tour, or find a nice slope for Telemarking or just enjoy the nice weather and make a couch in the snow, relaxing and reading some book.</p>
                              <h4>Day IV</h4>
                              <p>A period of the year when night and day almost looks the same. We get up real early in the morning, the sun already high on the sky. Today we heading back towards the civilisation, slightly downhill all the way back to Abisko. Then transfer back to Kiruna and the airport.</p>

                          <p class="lead">In this section we will try to give you the information you need to be able to bring right kind of cloth and equipment, but also give an idea about what you can expect.</p>
                          <p>On our skiing tours we cross the mountains on cross country skies. It is almost as hiking but on skies. No prepared tracks if we don´t find some one else tracks. If the snow is deep we better stay in a row, let first person making the tracks for the rest of us. But most often the snow is hard and we can skies on top.</p>
                          <p>The weather and temperature can change very much, even from day to day. In April we could have nice sunny days were we can ski only in our T-shirt. Or we might have strong wind, snow and ten degrees below zero, all clothes and goggles are needed.</p>

                          <h3>Clothes and equipment</h3>
                          <p>Layer on layer is the best, then you can adjust according to the temperature, and several thin layers is warmer than one thick layer. On top you have a shell or winter jacket and “tex-” (goretex or similar) or thermo trousers.</p>
                          <p>Warm gloves – two layers is a good choice, first a thin pair made of wool for example.</p>
                          <p>A cap that cover your ears properly.</p>
                          <p>Warm socks – made of wool or simular. Still warm even if they get humid.</p>
                          <br>
                          <p>A sunny day the light becomes very strong because of the white snow that reflex the sunlight. Without sun glasses you might even hurt your eyes. To bring sun glasses is essential.</p>

                              <p>Arrival, train from Stockholm to Läggesta. The guide meet the group at Läggesta station and help them get the right bus to Åkers Styckebruk (10 minutes with bus). Everyone get dry bags for the cloth, sleeping bag etc. We load the canoes, safety instructions and a short course, how to do the paddling best way. Start our tour along the shore with the sun in our face. Slow in the beginning make sure everyone get the right technique. After some hours it feels great to stop at some nice place and stretch our legs. Take something to eat and maybe a bath in the lake. Later we stop for lunch, a real meal made on the gas stove.</p>
                              <p>In the evening we find us a nice place for night camp. Put up our tents, making the fire and start making dinner together. Ending the day sitting around the fire locking at the stars.</p>
                              <h4>Day II</h4>
                              <p>Waking up close to the lake. Maybe start the day with a bath before breakfast. We pack all our stuff back in the canoes, leave no trace, and continue our journey. Today everyone is used to the canoe and can put more focus to the surroundings when following the shore line south. Once we need to stop and pull the canoe from one lake to the next. A small canoe wagon is very handy, we don’t need to carry. After several breaks and a nice lunch we reach Gnesta, our goal. An ice cream as reward before unload the canoes, arrange with the baggage and walk the 100 meters to the railway station and the train back towards Stockholm.</p>

                              <p class="lead">During three days we paddle kayaks in the beautiful archipelago of Nyköping. Between islands and skerries, out in the open sea and in seduced caves.</p>
                              <p>We sleep in tents on the islands along the way, prepare the food over open fire and wash ourselves in rock pools of the Baltic Sea.</p>

                              <p>With kayak out on the Baltic sea. Out among thousands of islands, most of them unsettled. The Swedish “allemansrätt” gives us the opportunity to stay on any one of them. There is no fix tour, the wind and waves affect our plans and you never now where to spend the night. During the day we make several stops, for a meal or just to stretch our legs. In the evening, after a swim we make a fire and start making dinner. Maybe we manage to catch some fish that we can fry in the pan.</p>

                              <p>Arrival to Skavsta Airport, transfer out to the Baltic Sea where the kayaks are waiting. We start with packing the belongings into dry bags and then into the kayak. Belongings not needed during the trip can be left behind. After a short introduction we head off out onto the water. We start slow to get comfortable with the kayak. Later on we reach a nice island where we go ashore, put up our tents and start making dinner over the open fire. Hopefully, the water is warm to swim.The night we spend in our tents, two persons each.</p>
                              <h4>Day II & III</h4>
                              <p>In the morning when the sun makes it warm we sit on the rocks with feet in the water eating our breakfast. When everything is back in the kayak we head out towards the open sea, leaving no trace that shows where we have spent the night.</p>
                              <p>The wind, weather and the fitness of the group decides how we plan our trip. We paddle between islets and skerrys, out into open sea and calm secluded bays. You learn about paddling technique and safety, reading coastal maps and about birds and animals of the archipelago. We stop at and visit historical and cultural places too. During the day, we will have several breaks to eat and to relax. In the evening we make our camp on another island.</p>
                              <h4>Day IV</h4>
                              <p>After breakfast we head back towards the starting point. We adjust our time schedule according to the departure of the aircraft. Back ashore we take something to eat and prepare ourselves for the trip home again. Transfer back to Stockholm Skavsta Airport.</p>

                          <p>You don´t need to have a lot of experience in kayak to be able to join this tour. Actually you can join even if you never done this before.</p>

                          <h3>About equipment you need</h3>
                          <p>While paddling you sitting in the kayak with a sprayskirt covering your legs. If we get bad weather you only need a waterproof jacket. Of course it could be nice with rain trousers if we have rain in the evening but it is not necessary.</p>
                          <p>More necessary is cloth that covers hour upper body. Long arm shirts, a hat or scarf and sun glasses. During a sunny day sitting in the kayak the whole day that close to the water that also reflects the sun you will easily get burned.</p>
                          <h3>About shoes</h3>
                          <p>When stepping in and out of the kayak you might need standing in the water. Barefooted or sandals is then recommended.

                          <p>Arrival at Skavsta Airport. After an introduction you get your bikes. While we take care of the baggage, you head towards the hostel on your bikes. The guide follows you and we find our way mostly on narrow roads. Later in the afternoon we reach the hostel and you can check in. The dinner is served and afterwards we might go for a short tour.</p>

                          <p>We eat a good and healthy breakfast and make our lunch packages. Then we head off on our bikes. Finding the most fun roads, we stop to make the best parts several times. We take our lunch in some nice location, maybe stop for a swim in one of the lakes we pass. If you like we come back to the hostel for a break before we do another trip or we spent the whole day out in the wild. In the evenings we make our dinner, preferably outdoors. Maybe we do some other activities like swimming, canoeing, or fishing.</p>
                          <h4>Day IV</h4>
                          <p>After breakfast we head back towards the airport. We adjust our time schedule for the departure of the aircraft. At the airport we take a shower and something to eat before the plane leaves.</p>

                          <p class="lead">In this section we will try to give you the information you need to be able to bring right kind of cloth and equipment, but also give an idea about what you can expect.</p>
                          <p>On our MTB weekends we stay at the same place the whole time. We do different tours every day, stay away the whole day or come back for lunch depending on the desire of the group. Part from your cloth for MTB you need a small backpack to bring something to eat during the tour, maybe a swim suite and a towel if we make a brake at some lake for a swim.</p>

                          We offer these types of accommodation:
                          <ul class="nothing-list">

                          <p>More information in accommodation</p>
                          <h3>Food</h3>
                          <p>We offer full board meals to all our packages, in some of the packages meals are served in restaurants, in others they are prepared by the guide and in other packages preparing the food is a part of the experience. We often eat some of the meals outside during the tours – food always tastes very good out in nature!</p>
                          <p>Information about, for example, vegetarians/vegans in the party, or about persons with allergies, needs to be provided well in advance.</p>
                          <h3>Groups</h3>
                          <p>All our guided adventures are for smaller groups, normally between  6-10 persons. There are fixed dates for all packages. We claim the right to  cancel a trip if there are less than 3 persons.</p>
                          <p>We can also help individuals with booking of extra nights, tickets  or activities if they would like to arrive earlier or leave later.</p>
                          <p>For an entire group (at least 6 persons) you choose any date that suites you.  Naturguiden has a high flexibility and can adjust any of the packages to meet  the wishes of an entire group.</p>
                          <p>If there is a group of less than 6 persons who would like to experience one  of our packages without other participants that is possible with an agreed  fee.</p>
                          <h3>Gradient</h3>
                          <p>The gradient on the packages is based on the needed condition  rather than the technical skills.</p>
                          <ul class="nothing-list">
                            <li><strong>Easy</strong>:  for everyone with “normal”  physique.</li>
                            <li><strong>Middle</strong>:  active people, but not necessary exercise  regularly</li>
                            <li><strong>Tough</strong>: nothing extreme, but recommended for  people that exercise regularly.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>The difficulty level of the activities and the tempo will of  course be suited to match the group.</p>
                          <h3>Environment</h3>
                          <p>All of Naturguiden activities take place in our wonderful  outdoors. To be able to continue doing this it is important to reduce the impact  on our countryside as much as possible. Naturguiden is a member of the Swedish  Ecotourism Society and we have products that are certified according to Natures  Best, <a href="http://www.naturesbestsweden.com/">www.naturesbestsweden.com</a></p>
                          <p>None of our packages contains activities that have a negative  impact on the environment (like rib boats, snowmobiles, etc). We try to minimize  the transports and use public transport as much as possible. Our goal is to  leave no trace.</p>
                          <h3>Price:</h3>
                          <p>All prices are given in Euro. We claim the right to change the  price due to changes in exchange rates.</p>

                          <h2 class="page-title">About Sweden</h2>
                          <p class="lead">Sweden have a lot to offer when coming to outdoor sports. With over 250.000 lakes, 1.350 km of coast with more than 40.000 islands, several big rivers, water is one big reason. We have one of the best area in the world for skating on natural ice, awesome. Kayak in the archipelago or on any of the lakes is also fantastic.</p>
                          <p>The forest is another reason for being a great outdoor nation, over 50% is forest. Fantastic opportunities for biking, hiking, hunting, cross country skies, snowmobiles, dog sledge and such things..</p>
                          <p>Then we have the mountains, high areas without trees. Down hill skies is almost a national sport . Cross country skies something all kids learn. Hiking on skies in the mountain is popular in wintertime and hiking in summertime of course. Visit the mountains in April the fifth season. Still cold and snow but long lasting sunny days.</p>
                          <p>Sweden is a long country 1.570 km and the climate change a lot from north to south. In winter the average temperature is around 0 degree in south and about minus 20 - 30 degrees in north. In summer  the temperature is around 20 - 25 degrees in south and around 10 degrees in north. Midnight sun in summer and   no sun at all during a couple of week around Christmas in north. To tell what´s normal in Sweden is not possible, it´s all about were you are.</p>
                          <p>It is all about space, we have 20 persons/km2 in Sweden. 8,8 million on 450.000 km2. Compare with Netherlands that have 375 persons/km2. Together with the ”allemansrätt” that gives us the  right to travel and camp anywhere (except in someone garden) Sweden is a perfect if you looking for freedom and peacefulness.</p>
                          <p>Our currency is still Kronor (SEK), we have not change to Euro. The exchange rate is around 9.2 SEK for 1 EUR. (If you divide the Swedish price with 10 you got the price in Euro approximately)</p>
                          <p>On all our tours everything you need is included (there is one exception). On some tours you not event get the opportunity to spend any money.</p>

                          <p class="lead">What about the weather, what can we expect when coming to Sweden?</p>
                          <p>As the main thing with the holiday is the outdoor activity, the weather is important.</p>
                          <p>The weather depends of course on time of year and where in Sweden the tour take place. We will here try to give you a ruff  idea so you know what to expect.</p>
                          <p>Below we present two tables with average temperature during night and during daytime for each month. You also see the amount of rain or snow for each month (it is measured in millimetre water, when it comes as snow you will get approximately ten times more in thickness.)</p>
                          <h3>Summertime</h3>
                          <p>The temperature is an average value and measured in the shadow.  In the mountain you might have down to four degrees and rain and windy even in the middle of the summer and it can be 25 degrees and clear blue sky a couple of days later. Here we are completely exposed to the weather, there is no shelter. We always recommend to bring both gloves, a cap and a swim suite when going to the mountains.</p>
                          <p>When hiking in the south of Sweden there is not that extremes, the forest give us shelter. A sunny day in July we can have around 25 – 30 degrees, and cold and rainy day it might be around 18 degrees.</p>
                          <p>When come to kayak tours you are more dependent to the weather and specially to the wind. But as there are thousands of small islands along the cost you can always get some shelter. The temperature relates to the temperature of the water. The spring is more cold than the autumn. Therefore late summer is the best choice for a kayak tour and even late autumn is fantastic in the archipelago. During summertime it is important to have a long arm jumper, sunglasses and a hat otherwise you might get burn being out on the water the whole day.</p>
                          <h3>Wintertime</h3>
                          <p>On our winter activities you can expect temperatures betweens zero and minus twenty degrees. It could be snowfall and windy. On our skating tours we might even have around zero and rain. And on our ski tours in the mountain during April or May there could such warm and sunny days that you can ski with only a T-shirt. The best recommendation is to have several layers of clothes to be able to adapt to the actual temperature.</p>
