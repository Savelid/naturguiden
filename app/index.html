                        <p>John Savelid is waiting for me at Stockholm airport holding a strange bag that looks like a rucksack with too many straps. "It's a day sack for skating," he tells me, "but also a life jacket in case you go through."</p>

                                      <p>It was the question on all of our minds, but I asked it: "How do you know when the ice isn't safe to skate on?" Niklas, our imperturbable guide, rubbed his chin, looked thoughtful for a moment, then offered up the distilled wisdom of a lifetime spent playing around on frozen water. "When it breaks," he said with a broad smile.</p>

I hadn’t expected this sudden, ­unnerving divide. I hadn’t expected to be so far from land. And I hadn’t ­expected to be told that the solid surface I was standing on was only 3in thick.</p>

                      <h3>Day I</strong></h3>
                      <p>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and takes you directly towards the chosen skating area. Arriving to the hostel/hotel you check in and then depending on the time of arrival we might be able to do some skating. We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. In the evening we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</p>
                      <h3>Day II – III</h3>
                      <p>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on the weather forecast and the ice situation on the lakes, we take off in the minibus towards the best possible skating area. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we get the gear on and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we make several stops when we go ashore to take something to eat or walk to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>
                      <h3>Day IV</h3>
                      <p>After breakfast we head off for another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the scheduled departure times. On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and change clothes and maybe for something to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.</p>

Kayak in the archipelago or on any of the lakes is also fantastic.</p>
                      <p>The forest is another reason for being a great outdoor nation, over 50% is forest. Fantastic opportunities for biking, hiking, hunting, cross country skies, snowmobiles, dog sledge and such things..</p>
                      <p>Then we have the mountains, high areas without trees. Down hill skies is almost a national sport . Cross country skies something all kids learn. Hiking on skies in the mountain is popular in wintertime and hiking in summertime of course. Visit the mountains in April the fifth season. Still cold and snow but long lasting sunny days.</p>
                      <p>Sweden is a long country 1.570 km and the climate change a lot from north to south. In winter the average temperature is around 0 degree in south and about minus 20 - 30 degrees in north. In summer  the temperature is around 20 - 25 degrees in south and around 10 degrees in north. Midnight sun in summer and   no sun at all during a couple of week around Christmas in north. To tell what´s normal in Sweden is not possible, it´s all about were you are.</p>
                      <p>It is all about space, we have 20 persons/km2 in Sweden. 8,8 million on 450.000 km2. Compare with Netherlands that have 375 persons/km2. Together with the ”allemansrätt” that gives us the  right to travel and camp anywhere (except in someone garden) Sweden is a perfect if you looking for freedom and peacefulness.</p>
                      <p>Our currency is still Kronor (SEK), we have not change to Euro. The exchange rate is around 9.2 SEK for 1 EUR. (If you divide the Swedish price with 10 you got the price in Euro approximately)</p>
                      <p>On all our tours everything you need is included (there is one exception). On some tours you not event get the opportunity to spend any money.</p>
                      <p>But if you want some money to be able to by a beer or something else, you can always redraw money on the airport. You can also use credit card almost everywhere.</p>
                      <p>You manage good with English in Sweden, most people will understand you. With other language there is more difficult even though there are people knowing German, French, Spanish....</p>

                      <h2 class="page-title">Weather in Sweden</h2>
                      <p class="lead">What about the weather, what can we expect when coming to Sweden?</p>
                      <p>As the main thing with the holiday is the outdoor activity, the weather is important.</p>
                      <p>The weather depends of course on time of year and where in Sweden the tour take place. We will here try to give you a ruff  idea so you know what to expect.</p>
                      <p>Below we present two tables with average temperature during night and during daytime for each month. You also see the amount of rain or snow for each month (it is measured in millimetre water, when it comes as snow you will get approximately ten times more in thickness.)</p>
                      <h3>Summertime</h3>
                      <p>The temperature is an average value and measured in the shadow.  In the mountain you might have down to four degrees and rain and windy even in the middle of the summer and it can be 25 degrees and clear blue sky a couple of days later. Here we are completely exposed to the weather, there is no shelter. We always recommend to bring both gloves, a cap and a swim suite when going to the mountains.</p>
                      <p>When hiking in the south of Sweden there is not that extremes, the forest give us shelter. A sunny day in July we can have around 25 – 30 degrees, and cold and rainy day it might be around 18 degrees.</p>
                      <p>When come to kayak tours you are more dependent to the weather and specially to the wind. But as there are thousands of small islands along the cost you can always get some shelter. The temperature relates to the temperature of the water. The spring is more cold than the autumn. Therefore late summer is the best choice for a kayak tour and even late autumn is fantastic in the archipelago. During summertime it is important to have a long arm jumper, sunglasses and a hat otherwise you might get burn being out on the water the whole day.</p>
                      <h3>Wintertime</h3>
                      <p>On our winter activities you can expect temperatures betweens zero and minus twenty degrees. It could be snowfall and windy. On our skating tours we might even have around zero and rain. And on our ski tours in the mountain during April or May there could such warm and sunny days that you can ski with only a T-shirt. The best recommendation is to have several layers of clothes to be able to adapt to the actual temperature.</p>
